Group 4
Project: Analyzing Global Air Quality Index (AQI) Data
Step 1: Data Collection: Group members will collect AQI data from 6 different cities. Each group member will use the OpenAQ API to fetch data for their assigned countries. We will ensure data includes key 
pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3) and covers a specific time frame (4 years).

Step 2: Data Cleaning and Processing: Clean and process the collected data to prepare it for analysis.
a.	Load Data:
o	Combine data from all group members into a single dataset.
b.	Handle Missing Values:
o	Fill or drop missing values as appropriate.
c.	Remove Duplicates:
o	Ensure there are no duplicate entries.
d.	Data Type Conversion:
o	Convert date columns to datetime objects and ensure numerical columns are correctly typed.
e.	Standardize Units:
o	Ensure pollutant measurements are standardized across different countries.

Step 3: Time Series Analytics: Analyze AQI trends over time for each country. 
o	Analyzing time-series data for each pollutant in each country to observe trends over time.

Step 4: Data Visualization: Create compelling visualizations to represent the findings.
a.	Line Chart: To visualize pollutant Levels Over Time for Each Country.
b.	Bar Chart: To compare the average levels of each pollutant across different countries using bar charts.

Step 5: Interpretation of Analysis and Graphs: Interpret the analysis and visualizations to derive meaningful insights.
o	We will discuss why certain cities might have higher or lower levels of pollutants. Consider factors like traffic, industrial activity, geography, and local policies.
o	Investigate the impact of specific events (e.g., holidays, lockdowns, wildfires) on air quality in different countries.

Step 6: Prepare Report and Presentation:
o	Summarize the methodology, analysis, and insights in a detailed report.
o	Create a presentation highlighting key points and visualizations.
